This project automates the process of testing your internet speed and posting the results on Twitter using Selenium.

## How It Works

1. **Internet Speed Test**: The bot uses Selenium to open the Speedtest website and performs a download/upload speed test.
2. **Twitter Post**: After getting the speed test results, the bot automatically logs into your Twitter account and posts the results as a tweet.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver)
- dotenv (for handling environment variables securely)
